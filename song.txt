We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding through the dark night, night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love,
but it's never enough, nah
As the sirens fill the lonely air
Oh, how did we get here
now now now babe
We see a storm is closing in
Pretending we ain't scared

[Chorus:]
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil
You brought a fire to a world so cold
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
